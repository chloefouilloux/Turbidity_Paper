water_spectra are the spectrophotometry measurements/analysis from nursery water samples from La Selva, CR.



## Data ##

LAS_VISION_OCT2022 is the raw data from La Selva, Costa Rica

*Trial* is the trial number (includes all permutations)
*Mean_Wave* is the average spectrophotometry wavelength intensity across three samples of water collected in nurseries.
*Range_Wave* is the range of spectrophotometry wavelength intensity within water samples of water collected in nurseries.
*Tad_ID* individual ID given to each tadpole
*Mass* is the mass of tadpoles in grams.
*Stage* is the Gosner (1961) stage to assess tadpole deveopment
*Condition* is the experimental background colour. Either "background" for checkered choice or "black/white" for experiments with predators.
*Predator* is the predator with which tadpole was faced.
*Exploration* is a count of how many times a tadpole changed zones during each trial.
*Cons_g* is the mass in grams of the conspecific visual stimulus
*Spider_mm* is the abdominal length of the spider visual stimulus
*Black* is how many times the tadpole was on a black square during checkered choice trial
*White* is how many times the tadpole was on a white square during checkered choice trial
*Rest* is how many times tadpole was resting
*Swim* is how many times tadpole was swimming
*Pivoting* is how many times tadpole was pivoting (turn 90Â°)
*Zone_1* (_2, _3) is how many times tadpole was in specificed zone
*rMean_OG* (b, g) are the mean red, blue, or green channel percent reflectance from photographs.
